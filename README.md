# Pixel_level_interpretability_PLI_CNN
Ennab-Mcheick algorithm for interpreting the medical image classification using fuzzy logic and convolutional neural networks
The Ennab-Mcheick algorithm for Pixel-Level Interpretability (PLI) is designed to enhance the transparency and interpretability of deep learning models in medical imaging. This algorithm employs fuzzy logic to provide fine-grained, pixel-level insights by assigning relevance scores to each pixel in an image, which helps in identifying critical regions influencing the model's predictions. By integrating fuzzification, fuzzy inference, and defuzzification processes, the algorithm translates complex neural network outputs into intuitive visual heatmaps. These heatmaps enable clinicians to visually understand and trust the AI's decision-making process, making it particularly valuable for high-stakes applications like pneumonia diagnosis from chest X-rays. The Ennab-Mcheick algorithm thus bridges the gap between AI accuracy and clinical interpretability, fostering greater confidence in AI-assisted diagnostics.
